Files you won't modify:
   lib/contracts.h       - Contracts for C
   lib/uint-queue.{c,h}  - Unsigned int queues
   lib/uint-stack.{c,h}  - Unsigned int stacks
   lib/xalloc.h          - NULL-checking allocation
   graph.h               - Interface to graphs
   Makefile              - Utility for building this project

Files you will modify:
   graph-search.{c,h}    - DFS and BFS algorithms
   graph-test.c          - Tests for graph functions you write
                           (you'll write test cases for connected here!)
   graph.c               - Graphs, implemented via adjacency matrix
