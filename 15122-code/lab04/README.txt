==========================================================

Files you won't modify:
   testlib.c0       - Contains functions you may find useful
                      for testing your code
   main.c0 	        - Runs the test cases you write
   checktest        - Autograder that will check the testcases you write
                      against a battery of bad implementations
	
Files you will modify:
   set-test.c0      - Create an exhaustive battery of tests 
                      for the intersect function

Compiling and running your code:
   % ./check-test

Checking against a specific student:
   % ./check-test -s <student_name>
